[{"content":"Background Few days ago, I tried to deploy Gitea on my VPS, and enabled SSH connection. However, the SSH connection can expose my IP address, which does harm to privacy and security. So I tried to find ways to hide my IP. Finally, I decided to use Cloudflare Tunnel.\nAt first, I followed ChatGPT and Cloudflare official document steps to deploy Cloudflare Tunnel, and everything went well in the beginning. But in the next morning, I found that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t connect to my VPS through SSH, and all of my services were down. To address this problem, I logged into the website of the provider, Greencloud and tried to reach my VPS through the official terminal. When I launched the terminal, it required me to key in username and password to log in. The username, root, is short and easy to type in, while my password was too long to type in manually. It is worse that Greencloud does not provide copy and paste function in its console. That is, my password blocked myself.\nSo I had to find ways to log in my VPS. And during this process, I found a way to bypass the password authentication and run bash as root user through grub. Now, I would like to introduce this method to you.\nMethod Greencloud does not provide copy and paste function, but it offers Send CtrlAltDel function, which can force the VPS to reboot, enabling escalate privileges through grub.\nIn the grub interface, press e to edit the commands before booting. By default, the line starting with linux may look like:\n1 linux /boot/xxx root=UUID=xxx ro quiet Then appended a statement to this command like below:\n1 linux /boot/xxx root=UUID=xxx ro quiet init=/bin/bash In this way, the machine will boot and launch /bin/bash as root. Now, press Ctrl + X to boot. Then, the screen may look like:\nFrom the screenshot above, it is clear that we have logged in as root. So the next step is to modify the password.\nUsually, we can use command passwd to modify the password. But in this case, the whole disk is in read-only mode, causing the passwd command to fail like below:\n![Fail to run `passwd`](https://img.fovir.fyi/blog/escalate-privilege-from-grub-fail-to-passwd.png#center) So before running passwd, it needs to mount the disk with read and write mode at first. The command is below:\n1 mount -o remount,rw / This command mounts the root directory in read and write mode, and now we can use passwd to change the password.\nThen, it comes to the final step. Since it is in the booting stage, which means the machine has not started yet, it is not suitable to use reboot to restart the system. Instead, we should execute /sbin/init to continue booting. So run this command:\n1 exec /sbin/init After that, we can see the login interface. Now input the username and the new password, and it will log in successfully.\nPrevention There are many ways to prevent this threat, such as encrypting the disk and encrypting the grub. I would like to introduce the later one here.\nTo encrypt grub, run the following command to create a password.\n1 grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 After inputting the password, it will output a string of hash value. Copy it and then edit the file /etc/grub.d/40_custom, append the following content to it:\n1 2 set superusers=\u0026#34;root\u0026#34; password_pbkdf2 root your_hash_string Replace the your_hash_string with the hash value generated before.\nAnd finally, run grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg to apply the change.\nAfter that, if someone wants to modify the password through grub, he/she is required to enter the password at first, preventing the escalation of privileges from happening.\nReference ChatGPT\n","permalink":"https://www.fovir.fyi/posts/2025/escalate_privileges_from_grub/","summary":"This post records a method of using grub to escalate privileges that was accidentally discovered during the deployment of Cloudflare Tunnel.","title":"Escalate Privileges from Grub"}]
